### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Andrea, a Full-Stack Instructor @ [Grand Circus](https://www.grandcircus.co/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&aff=facebookorganic), teaching a curriculum that focuses on the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

My background is actually in Graphic Design! After recieving my BFA in Graphic Design from Western Michigan University, I worked for 7 years for various enterprises and freelance clients.

Now, I'm taking my love for problem-solving to the next level by adding JavaScript, and more, to my website-creating skills. And not only that, but I get to teach students who were once in my place, in hopes to advance their careers into the world of tech.

A little more about me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first React Native project!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: <andrea.z.hoffman@gmail.com>
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to live in Portand, OR!
